RecognITE is an application designed to simplify the process of identifying potential violations of the Electronic Information and Transaction Law (ITE Law) in Indonesia. RecognITE addresses the urgent need for a simpler understanding of Indonesia's Electronic Information and Transaction Law (ITE Law), given the rapid expansion of online content. RecognITE enables users to quickly determine whether digital content complies with ITE Law restrictions by utilizing cutting-edge NLP and image analysis technology. In addition to lowering legal risks and promoting appropriate online behavior, the software offers real-time feedback on textual and graphic aspects. RecognITE is a vital tool that helps people and organizations navigate the challenges of complying with ITE Laws. It does this by providing an intuitive interface and proactive content evaluation functions. In order to determine whether or not the content to be provided breaches the ITE Law, RecognITE can also be utilized as a preventative step. RecognITE therefore gives users the chance to confirm that content complies with laws before it is released.
